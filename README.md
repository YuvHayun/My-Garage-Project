# My Garage Project

My Garage Project is an OOP project.
The main idea of this project is to show the use of Exceptions and OOP concepts such as Inheritance, Isomorphism, and Abstraction.
The project is base on a garage that can handle multiple types of cars with different kinds of engines.
also, the garage can handle tasks that may defer between each type of vehicle universally.
For your convenience, there's also a diagram that describes the hierarchies of inheritance and relations between the classes.
